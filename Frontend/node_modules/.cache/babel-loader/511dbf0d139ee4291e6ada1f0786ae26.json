But if in future\n                  we wish\n                  to monetize the website, we would only use generic data such\n                  as site\n                  traffic and statistics and of course we would notify the\n                  change\n                  prior hand with enough time for users to delete their data\n                  from the\n                  website if they want to. </p>\n\n                <h2>Third Party tie-ups</h2>\n\n                <p align=\"justify\">As of now, we have not integrated any third\n                  party services like\n                  Google, Facebook or Twitter on the website. Should we in\n                  future\n                  decide to add third party features, we would update this\n                  section and\n                  simultaneously notify users beforehand about any changes. </p>\n\n\n                <h2>Data transfer and retention practices</h2>\n\n                <p align=\"justify\">Our team believes user privacy and security\n                  are of the utmost\n                  importance and hence we adopt the best practices out there to\n                  ensure\n                  user’s sensitive information like password is not leaked out\n                  or is\n                  not accessed by any malicious entity. To walk you through the\n                  practices, let us take user registration for example, whenever\n                  the\n                  user enters his/her details in the registration form and\n                  clicks\n                  submit. The sensitive information such as email address and\n                  password\n                  is encrypted using a military grade encryption technique. And\n                  the\n                  data is further hashed on the server side and stored in the DB\n                  making it impossible for anyone(including us) to decrypt it.\n                  To\n                  conclude your data is stored in a secured DB as hashes that\n                  makes it\n                  virtually impenetrable. And if ever in future a user decides\n                  to take\n                  away his/hers data. He/She can delete the profile under the\n                  profile\n                  tab on the website. Doing so would result in deleting data\n                  permanently that cannot be recovered in the future. </p>\n\n\n                <h2>Motivation</h2>\n\n                <p align=\"justify\">Our team believes user privacy as a\n                  fundamental right to a human\n                  being. And even though we have the option to sell user’s data\n                  such\n                  as email and flight history, we believe it is against our\n                  principles\n                  to sell data without any consent. And hence we again make it\n                  clear\n                  that user data is stored only for the website’s functionality\n                  and to\n                  improve user experience.</p>\n\n                <h2>Privacy Policy Updates</h2>\n                <p align=\"justify\">The privacy policy is subject to change as we\n                  integrate more\n                  services and we use novel technologies for the betterment of\n                  the\n                  website.
